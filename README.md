# random quote generator

Summary: This is a solution to the Free Code Camp (FCC) intermediate front-end development project task to create a random quote generator page.

Resources: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 3, Javascript, jQuery, JSON, Forismatic API, Twitter, CodePen.

Notes: This is one of the intermediate challenges included in the FCC Front-End Web Developer certification course. The requirement was to build a random quote generator page that would display a new random quotation each time a button is pressed. It also required the facility to post the quote as a tweet on Twitter. Random quotes are accessed by a JS/jQuery script that makes a request to the Forismatic.com API with results returned in JSON.
